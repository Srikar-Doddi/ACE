# ACE (AI Coding Enhancer) Framework

A Structured Prompting Protocol for Optimized AI-Assisted Code Generation

---

## 🌟 Overview

**ACE** is a structured framework for enhancing interactions with AI coding assistants. It transforms a raw request into a guided, collaborative development session by dividing the process into clear, logical stages. Whether writing utilities, exploring design patterns, or generating robust, production-grade code, ACE encourages depth, rigor, and iteration.

This version integrates upgrades inspired by the ORION protocol: confidence scoring, optional developer goal mapping, and iterative feedback loops.

---

## 🔄 When to Use ACE

Use ACE for any of the following:

* Designing new features, APIs, or CLI tools
* Debugging or optimizing existing code
* Refactoring large or critical systems
* Developing reusable scripts or libraries

Adaptable modes:

* **Quick Mode**: Simple, well-defined tasks
* **Standard Mode** *(default)*: Moderately complex tasks
* **Deep Clean Mode**: Critical systems, novel problems, edge-heavy logic

---

## ⚙️ ACE Framework Steps

### **Step 1: Get on the Same Page**

> “The What & Why"

**Objective**: Clarify user intent, scope, and goals.

**AI Tasks**:

* Restate core objective
* List explicit and inferred requirements
* Highlight assumptions
* Flag potential ambiguities
* ✨ *NEW*: Assign a confidence score (High/Medium/Low)

---

### **Step 2: Plan the Attack**

> “The How & What If"

**Objective**: Strategically explore solution paths

**AI Tasks**:

* Propose 2–3 solution strategies
* Discuss pros/cons and risks of each
* Identify edge cases and likely pitfalls
* Recommend the most suitable path

---

### **Step 3: Sketch it Out**

> “The Blueprint"

**Objective**: Design before coding

**AI Tasks**:

* Produce structured pseudocode or logic steps
* Define function responsibilities
* Validate completeness and internal coherence
* Highlight data flow and key decisions

---

### **Step 4: Build it**

> “The Code"

**Objective**: Translate blueprint into functional code

**AI Tasks**:

* Generate clear, well-commented code
* Match logic to blueprint exactly
* Use modern, idiomatic patterns

---

### **Step 5: Polish & Perfect**

> “Make it Shine"

**Objective**: Iteratively refine the draft

**AI Tasks**:

* Accept user-directed enhancement requests
* Improve:

  * Readability
  * Performance
  * Error handling
  * Test coverage
  * Security concerns
* Repeat cycles as needed (focus one aspect per pass)

---

### **Step 6: Finalize & Explain**

> “The Handoff"

**Objective**: Deliver a complete and usable solution

**AI Tasks**:

* Present final code
* Include:

  * Usage notes / examples
  * Dependencies
  * Integration or deployment hints
  * Optional test cases
* ✨ *Optional*: Suggest reusable prompt templates or modular components

---

### ➕ **(Optional) Step 7: Reflect & Rewind**

> “Post-mortem & Re-entry Point"

**Objective**: Reflect on code quality and loop back if needed

**AI Tasks**:

* Ask: Did this solve the full problem?
* If not:

  * Recommend step to revisit (e.g., Step 2 or 5)
  * Carry forward learnings to the next iteration

## 🔗 Developer Goal Mapping

| Developer Goal             | Key ACE Step(s)  |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Avoid bugs early           | Step 1 + Step 3  |
| Explore optimal strategies | Step 2           |
| Build reusable utilities   | Step 4 + Step 6  |
| Refactor with clarity      | Step 3 + Step 5  |
| Harden code for prod       | Step 5 (iterate) |
| Generate robust CLIs       | Step 3 + Step 4  |
| Provide full context       | Step 6           |

## 🔬 Example Use Case: Python Word Counter

> See accompanying `examples/word_counter_standard_mode.md` to view how ACE transforms a simple direct request into a robust, reusable script with clear CLI, error handling, and performance tuning.

---

## 🏆 Benefits

* Reduced misinterpretation and false assumptions
* Proactive edge case identification
* Cleaner abstractions and scalable logic
* Less debugging, more deliberate iteration
* A true co-pilot relationship between dev and AI

---

## 🚀 Ready to Use

Copy/paste the ACE steps into your AI interaction window and begin your task. Start with:

```text
Use the ACE Framework in Standard Mode.
Step 1: Here is my coding task...
```

You can then guide the assistant step by step, or let it proceed through all stages if you're using a smart agent wrapper.
